    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Coming from an IT background, Debra is always keen to explore more
      opportunities that the technological world has to offer. During her
      undergraduate studies in the Faculty of Computer Science at University of
      Indonesia, Debra found her passion in the fields of data science, data
      analytics, and machine learning. Additionally, her interest in the health
      and medical field elevated her ambitions to apply the knowledge of machine
      learning and artificial intelligence in that specific field. Currently,
      Debra is continuing to learn more and more about neural networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from data, Debra also has an interest in the software engineering
      field, specializing in web development in both back-end and front-end
      roles and has worked on numerous software development projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an individual, Debra is able to work efficiently both as an individual
      or in a team and is capable of doing tasks to the maximum of her abilities
      even within an urgent given deadline. She has had several volunteering and
      organizational experiences during her undergraduate studies. She is also a
      person that loves to come out of her comfort zone and challenge herself in
      doing something she's never done before.
